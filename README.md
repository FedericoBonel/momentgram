## What is included in this repo?

All the system required to deploy your own instagram clone and the documentation on how to do it.

## Where do I start?

Go first into the [back-end](https://github.com/FedericoBonel/momentgram/tree/master/server) code and run it (since the front end needs it to work properly) and then go into the [front-end](https://github.com/FedericoBonel/momentgram/tree/master/client) code and run it.
More information about how to run each side and deploy it is included in each folder.
